Intro Git Demo

- `git clone <URL>`: takes what's on github and does a one time download to your computer
- `git status`: tells you what is going on in the repository
- `git add <FILE>`: add the <FILE> to the staging area
- `git commit`: commit the file to github! (aka snapshot)

but... there is a shortcut 
- `git commit -m "MESSAGE"`: create the git message directly in the command line
  
- `git push origin main`:  sends code from branch "main" local computer to the remote origin
